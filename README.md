## Project Overview

Scrapeless provides essential infrastructure for building AI agents and automations, powering AI workflows and data extraction through advanced browser-based tools.

Scrapeless supports multiple invocation methods, including SDKs and APIs, and can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream automation platforms such as:

- **n8n**: An open-source workflow automation tool with visual flow design.
- **Make**: A powerful visual integration platform with rich connectors and workflows.
- **Pipedream**: A low-code integration platform for developers, enabling flexible custom events and flows.
- **MCP Server**: The Scrapeless MCP Server can be integrated into automation platforms to build custom workflow templates.

**This repository contains:**

- Code examples directly calling the Scrapeless SDK, helping developers get started quickly.
- Best practice cases of Scrapeless integration with major automation platforms.
- Integration examples based on the Scrapeless MCP Server.

The repository is practice-oriented and categorized by different scenarios, showcasing various typical use cases to help B2B clients, SaaS developers, and automation engineers get started efficiently.
